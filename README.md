# Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains various algorithms explained in my YouTube videos. The goal is to provide clear, easy-to-understand code implementations for common algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and is accompanied by explanations that can help you grasp the core concepts of computer science and problem-solving.

Feel free to explore the code and check out the corresponding video tutorials for in-depth explanations.

## Usage

To use any of the algorithms in this repository, simply download or clone the repository and run the Python scripts. The algorithms are implemented in standalone functions, and you can call them with any relevant inputs.

### Example Usage:

```python
import manacher_longest_substring

# Find the longest palindromic substring in a string
result = manacher_longest_substring("racecar")
print(result)  # Output: 'racecar'
```
